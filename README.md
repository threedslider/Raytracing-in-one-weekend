# Raytracing-in-one-weekend

Intro
==========

I am inspired by this stuff as Ray Tracing in One Weekend and this link is here : [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

I have writing in Purebasic programming and adapted by me :) So It works as wonderful images and fun to make it too !

So I thank all the developer from this ;)

Maybe it is not well writed but it works so you can see and to test it.

File 1, 2, 3 and 4 is writed in image file and 5 and 6 rendered in Purebasic without image file, voil√†.

Update : file 7 adding.


Happy coding !



PS : Tested with Purebasic version 6.04.
